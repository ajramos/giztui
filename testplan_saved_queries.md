# Test Plan: Saved Queries Feature

## Feature Overview
The Saved Queries feature allows users to save, organize, and quickly access frequent search patterns as bookmarks. Users can save current searches using an Obsidian-style bottom-right input panel, browse existing bookmarks with a prompts-style picker interface, and execute saved queries instantly through keyboard shortcuts, number keys (1-9), and commands. The feature provides consistent UI patterns and theming throughout.

## Prerequisites

### Configuration Requirements
- Valid Gmail TUI configuration with OAuth credentials
- Internet connection for Gmail API access  
- Test Gmail account with diverse message types for search testing
- SQLite database permissions for bookmark storage

### Sample Data Setup
1. **Diverse Message Types** - Ensure test account has:
   - Messages with attachments (`has:attachment`)
   - Messages from specific senders (`from:boss@company.com`)
   - Messages with labels (`label:important`)
   - Unread messages (`is:unread`)
   - Messages in date ranges (`after:2024-01-01`)
   - Large messages (`larger:1MB`)

2. **Search Query Examples** for testing:
   - Simple: `has:attachment`
   - Complex: `from:notifications@github.com has:attachment after:2024-01-01`
   - Label-based: `label:work is:unread`
   - Date range: `before:2023-12-31 larger:5MB`
   - Subject-based: `subject:"weekly report" from:team@company.com`

### Environment Verification
- Verify `~/.config/giztui/` directory permissions
- Test database creation/migration permissions
- Confirm keyboard shortcuts not conflicting with system shortcuts
- **Verify theme system integration and consistent styling**
- **Test focus management and border highlighting**
- **Verify UI pattern consistency with existing pickers and panels**
