# üîÑ Undo Functionality Test Plan

## üìã **Feature Overview**
Testing the comprehensive undo functionality that allows users to reverse email actions (archive, trash, mark read/unread, label operations) using the `U` key or `:undo` command.

## üéØ **Prerequisites**
1. Gmail TUI application built with undo functionality
2. Valid Gmail account with test messages
