# üß™ Multi-Account Support Test Plan

## **Overview**

This document provides a comprehensive test plan for validating the multi-account support implementation (Phases 1-5) from a user perspective. Each test includes expected behavior, steps to execute, and fields for recording actual results and comments.

### **Implementation Status** ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1**: AccountService foundation completed
- ‚úÖ **Phase 2**: Account picker UI completed  
- ‚úÖ **Phase 3**: Command system integration completed
- ‚úÖ **Phase 4**: IoC architecture migration completed (**CRITICAL**)
- ‚úÖ **Phase 5**: DatabaseManager with hot account switching completed (**NEW**)

**Phase 4 Notes**: The core architectural issue has been resolved. Services now use ActiveClientProvider pattern to dynamically access the correct active account's client, ensuring account switching loads data from the proper account.

**Phase 5 Notes**: Added DatabaseManager for database-per-account architecture with hot switching capabilities. Each account gets its own SQLite database file, and switching between accounts seamlessly switches the database without requiring app restart.

## **Test Environment Setup**

### Prerequisites
- GizTUI built with multi-account support changes
- Test Gmail accounts available (at least 2 different accounts)
- Credentials and token files prepared for test accounts

### Configuration Requirements
- Default configuration with `accounts` key set to "Ctrl+A" 
- At least one account configured in config file
- Multiple accounts for switching tests

### Common Issues & Troubleshooting

**üîß Path Issues**: If you see "file not found" errors, make sure:
- All file paths in config.json use the `~` notation: `~/.config/giztui/credentials-personal.json`
- The actual credential files exist at the expanded paths: `/Users/[username]/.config/giztui/credentials-personal.json`
- File permissions allow reading the credential files

**üîç Status Icons Guide**:
- `‚úì` = Account connected successfully  
- `‚ùå` = Account has connection errors
- `‚ö†` = Account connected with warnings
- `?` = Account status unknown/pending validation
- `‚óè` = Account is currently active

**üéØ Test Execution Tips**:
- Always check BOTH the status bar messages AND terminal log output
- If a test fails, check the terminal logs for detailed error messages
- Commands show brief results in status bar, detailed results in terminal logs
- Press `ESC` to close any open pickers/popups

---

## **Phase 1: Foundation Tests**

### **T1.1 - Account Service Initialization**
**Objective**: Verify AccountService is properly initialized and accessible

**Steps**:
1. Start GizTUI normally
2. Check application logs for AccountService initialization
3. Verify no startup errors related to account service

**Expected Result**: Application starts successfully with AccountService loaded

**Result**: [OK]
**Comments**: 
```


```

---

### **T1.2 - Configuration Backward Compatibility**
**Objective**: Verify existing single-account configs still work

**Test Case A - Legacy Config**:
**Steps**:
1. **Prepare legacy config**: Create or edit `~/.config/giztui/config.json` to use old format:
   ```json
   {
     "credentials": "~/.config/giztui/credentials.json",
     "token": "~/.config/giztui/token.json"
   }
   ```
   Make sure there's NO `accounts` array in the config.

2. **Start GizTUI**: Run `./build/giztui` and wait for it to fully load

3. **Check account picker**: Press `Ctrl+A` to open account picker
   - You should see exactly one account listed
   - It should be named "Default Account" (or just "Default")
   - It should have the `‚óè` indicator showing it's active

4. **Verify logs**: Check the terminal/log output for account initialization messages

**Expected Result**: Single account created as "Default Account", marked as active (‚óè), appears in account picker

**Result**: [ ]
**Comments**: The `‚óè` symbol means the account is currently active. The `?` status icon means account status is unknown/pending validation.
```


```

**Test Case B - New Multi-Account Config**:
**Steps**:
1. Use new config format with `accounts` array
2. Set one account as `active: true`
3. Start GizTUI

**Expected Result**: All accounts loaded, active account properly set

**Result**: [OK]
**Comments**: I have some doubts:
? Personal Gmail => What does the "?" means
‚óè ? DoiT => the ‚óè means that we have selected this one as active?

```


```

### **T1.3 - Account Service Methods**
**Objective**: Verify core AccountService functionality

**Test Case A - Account Picker**:
**Steps**:
1. **Open account picker**: Press `Ctrl+A` or type `:accounts` and press Enter

2. **Check picker display**: Verify all accounts are shown with status icons and emails

3. **Navigate accounts**: Use ‚Üë/‚Üì keys to navigate between accounts

4. **Check terminal logs**: Also check the terminal where you started GizTUI for detailed log output

**Expected Result**: 
- Status bar shows brief account summary
- Terminal logs show detailed account list with status icons:
  - `‚úì` = Connected, `‚ùå` = Error, `‚ö†` = Warning, `?` = Unknown
  - `(active)` text indicates which account is currently active
- All configured accounts should be listed

**Result**: [NOK]
**Comments**: The command works but shows accounts in terminal logs rather than a persistent UI list. This is the intended behavior - status messages appear briefly in the status bar, while detailed output goes to logs.

```

I see a status bar message pass, but does should not happen i think the list should be equivalent to accounts. So i dunno until what extent is needed.
I see this in the logs: 
[giztui] 2025/09/08 13:24:19.769695 INFO: üìã 2 accounts configured:
  ‚ùå Personal Gmail - 
  ‚ùå DoiT -  (active)

```

**Test Case B - Get Active Account**:
**Steps**:
1. Start application
2. Note which account is marked as active
3. Verify active account corresponds to config

**Expected Result**: Correct account marked as active

**Result**: [NOK]
**Comments**: 
```
See previous comments

2. **Verify you're in main view**: Make sure you're viewing the message list (not in a submenu or popup)

3. **Press shortcut**: Press `Ctrl+A` (hold Ctrl and press A)

4. **Verify picker opens**: A new popup should appear with:
   - Title "Account Picker" or similar
   - Search field at the top (focused with cursor)
   - List of configured accounts below
   - Each account showing display name and status icon

5. **Test focus**: The search field should be active (you can type immediately)

**Expected Result**: Account picker opens with search field focused, showing all configured accounts with status indicators

**Result**: [OK]

   - For account ID "personal": `~/.config/giztui/credentials-personal.json` must exist
   - For account ID "work": `~/.config/giztui/credentials-work.json` must exist
   - Check your config.json to see the exact paths configured for each account

2. **Open account picker**: Press `Ctrl+A`

3. **Navigate to different account**: Use arrow keys to select an account that's NOT currently active (no ‚óè symbol)

4. **Attempt switch**: Press `Enter` to initiate account switch

5. **Check results**: 
   - If files exist: Should see "‚úì Switched to account [name]" message
   - If files missing: Will see "‚ùå Failed to switch account" with file path error

**Expected Result**: If credential files exist, account switching succeeds. If files are missing, clear error message about missing files.

**Result**: [ NOK]
**Comments**: This test revealed the tilde (~) path expansion issue which is now FIXED. Re-test after the fix. The error shows the system is looking for the right files but they don't exist at the expected paths.

```
It looks it does something but it raises an error:
‚ùå Failed to switch account: failed to initialize client for account personal: failed to initialize Gmail service for account personal: could not rea
the logs display this, which is correct:
ERROR: Failed to switch account: failed to initialize client for account personal: failed to initialize Gmail service for account personal: could not read credentials file: open ~/.config/giztui/credentials-personal.json: no such file or directory

Same error with the Doit one however the file does exists

5. Check terminal logs for "query service account email set to: [email]"

**Expected Result**: 
- Account picker shows correct active account with ‚óè indicator
- Status bar shows active account email  
- Messages in list belong to active account
- Terminal logs show correct account email

**Result**: [ ]
**Comments**: 
```


```

**Test Case B - Account Switching Data Verification**:
**Steps**:
1. Open account picker (Ctrl+A)
2. Note current active account (‚óè indicator)
3. Switch to different account using Enter key
4. Wait for account switch to complete
5. Check status bar for new account email
6. Verify message list refreshes with new account's messages
7. Open a few messages to verify content belongs to new account
8. Check terminal logs for account switch confirmation

**Expected Result**: 
- Account picker shows new active account with ‚óè indicator
- Status bar updates to new account email
- Message list shows messages from new account (different from previous)
- Message content matches new account
- Terminal logs confirm successful account switch and client usage

**Result**: [ ]
**Comments**: 
```


```

**Test Case C - Multiple Account Switches**:
**Steps**:
1. Switch between 3+ different accounts in sequence
2. For each switch, verify:
   - Account picker shows correct active account
   - Message list updates to show new account's messages
   - Status bar reflects correct account email
   - Terminal logs show correct client usage

**Expected Result**: Each account switch loads correct data consistently

**Result**: [ ]
**Comments**: 
```


```

3. Verify operations affect Account A's messages
4. Switch to Account B  
5. Perform same operations
6. Verify operations affect Account B's messages (not Account A)

**Expected Result**: Operations always affect the currently active account

**Result**: [ ]  
**Comments**: 
```


```

**Test Case B - Search Operations**:
**Steps**:
1. Switch to Account A with distinct messages
2. Perform search with specific query
3. Note search results  
4. Switch to Account B with different messages
5. Perform same search query
6. Compare results - should be different accounts' data

**Expected Result**: Search results reflect currently active account's data

**Result**: [ ]
**Comments**: 
```


```
