## 🎯 Overview

GizTUI uses **automated GitHub workflows** for releases. The process is:

1. **Prepare**: Update version files and changelog
2. **Trigger**: Tag and push to trigger automated workflow  
3. **Verify**: Confirm workflow success and test installation

**Important**: The workflow handles building, packaging, and publishing. Never bypass it with manual processes.

## ✅ Pre-Release Checklist

Before starting any release, ensure all these conditions are met:

### **Code Quality Gates**
- [ ] All features are complete and tested
- [ ] All tests pass: `make test`
- [ ] Linting passes: `make lint` 
- [ ] Code formatting is correct: `make fmt`
- [ ] No critical issues in `make vet`
- [ ] All pre-commit hooks pass

### **Architecture Compliance** 
- [ ] All new features follow service-first architecture
- [ ] Command parity implemented (every keyboard shortcut has `:command`)
- [ ] Proper error handling using `ErrorHandler` pattern

- [ ] Currently on `main` branch
- [ ] Local `main` is up to date with `origin/main`

## 📊 Semantic Versioning Guidelines

GizTUI follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

### **MAJOR Version (X.0.0)**
Increment when making **breaking changes**:
- Configuration format changes
- Command syntax changes
- Removed features or options
- API compatibility breaks

### **MINOR Version (X.Y.0)**
Increment when adding **new features** (backward compatible):
- New keyboard shortcuts or commands
- New integrations (Slack, Obsidian, etc.)
- New AI features or providers
- New configuration options
- Enhanced existing functionality

### **PATCH Version (X.Y.Z)**
Increment for **bug fixes and improvements** (backward compatible):
- Bug fixes
- Performance improvements
- Code refactoring
- Documentation updates
- Dependency updates

## 🎯 Release Process

### **Phase 1: Version Planning**

1. **Determine Version Type**
   ```bash
   # Review changes since last release
   git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..HEAD --oneline
   ```

2. **Choose New Version Number**
   ```bash
   # Check current version
   make version
   cat VERSION
   
   # Decide: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
   # Examples:
   # Bug fixes: 1.1.0 → 1.1.1
   # New feature: 1.1.1 → 1.2.0  
   # Breaking change: 1.2.0 → 2.0.0
   ```

### **Phase 2: Version File Updates**

3. **Update VERSION File**
   ```bash
   # Replace X.Y.Z with your target version
   echo "X.Y.Z" > VERSION
   
   # Verify the change
   make version
   ```

4. **Update version.go File (CRITICAL)**
   ```bash
   # CRITICAL: Update hardcoded version for go install consistency
   # Edit internal/version/version.go line 13:
   # Change: Version = "OLD.VERSION" 
   # To:     Version = "X.Y.Z"
   
   # Verify both files are in sync:
   echo "VERSION file: $(cat VERSION)"
   grep 'Version = ' internal/version/version.go
   ```

5. **Update CHANGELOG.md**
   
   Add a new section at the top of CHANGELOG.md:
   ```markdown
   ## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD

   ### ✨ New Features
   - **Feature Name**: Brief description of what was added
   - **Enhancement**: Description of improvements

   ### 🛠️ Technical Improvements
   - **Area**: Description of technical changes
   - **Quality**: Code quality or architecture improvements

   ### 🐛 Bug Fixes (if any)
   - **Issue**: Description of what was fixed

   ---
   ```

   **Keep it concise** - Focus on user-visible changes and major technical improvements.

### **Phase 3: Pre-Release Validation**

6. **Run Local Tests**
   ```bash
   # Comprehensive local validation
   make test
   make lint
   make vet
   
   # Verify no issues
   echo "Exit code: $?"
   ```

7. **Build Test**
   ```bash
   # Optional: Test local build to ensure everything compiles
   make build
   ./build/giztui-$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')-$(uname -m) --version
   # Should show: GizTUI X.Y.Z
   ```

### **Phase 4: Release Trigger**

8. **Commit Version Changes**
   ```bash
   # Stage version files (all three are required)
   git add VERSION CHANGELOG.md internal/version/version.go
   
   # Commit with standardized message
   git commit -m "release: prepare vX.Y.Z for [feature name]

   - Update VERSION from A.B.C to X.Y.Z
   - Update version.go hardcoded version for go install consistency  
   - Add CHANGELOG.md entry documenting changes"
   ```

9. **Create and Push Tag**
   ```bash
   # Create release tag
   git tag vX.Y.Z
   
   # Push everything to trigger the automated workflow
   git push origin main
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   
   # The GitHub workflow will now automatically:
   # - Build binaries for all platforms with injected version info
   # - Run comprehensive tests and quality checks
   # - Generate checksums and archives
   # - Create GitHub release with assets and release notes
   ```

### **Phase 5: Automated Workflow**

10. **Monitor Workflow Execution**
    ```bash
    # Check workflow status
    gh run list --limit 1
    
    # Watch workflow progress (optional)
    gh run watch
    
    # Workflow URL: https://github.com/ajramos/giztui/actions
    ```

    The automated workflow performs:
    - ✅ Multi-platform binary builds with version injection
    - ✅ Comprehensive test suite execution
    - ✅ Security scanning and quality checks
    - ✅ Checksum generation for all assets
    - ✅ Archive creation (.tar.gz, .zip)
    - ✅ GitHub release creation with release notes
    - ✅ Asset upload and publishing

## 🎯 Post-Release Tasks

### **Phase 6: Verification**

11. **Verify Release Completion**
    ```bash
    # Check GitHub release was created
    gh release view vX.Y.Z
    
    # Verify workflow succeeded
    gh run list --limit 1 --json conclusion
    ```

12. **Test Installation Methods**
    ```bash
    # Test go install (most common user method)
    go install github.com/ajramos/giztui/cmd/giztui@vX.Y.Z
    giztui --version
    # Should show: GizTUI X.Y.Z
    
    # Test binary download (optional)
    gh release download vX.Y.Z
    ```

13. **Update Documentation** (if needed)
    ```bash
    # Update installation instructions in README.md
    # Update any version-specific documentation
    ```

### **Communication**

14. **Announce Release** (optional)
    - Update project README with new version
    - Announce in relevant channels/communities
    - Update package manager entries if applicable

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Workflow Failures**

**Problem**: GitHub workflow fails during build
```bash
# Solution: Check workflow logs and fix issues locally first
gh run list --limit 1
gh run view [RUN_ID]

# Common fixes:
make test        # Fix failing tests
make lint        # Fix linting issues  
make vet         # Fix static analysis issues
```

**Problem**: Version injection not working in workflow
```bash
# Check that VERSION file format is correct
cat VERSION      # Should contain just: X.Y.Z (no 'v' prefix)

# Verify tag format is correct
git tag --list | tail -1   # Should be: vX.Y.Z
```

**Problem**: Go install still shows old version
```bash
# Solution: Ensure version.go was updated AND committed before tagging
grep 'Version = ' internal/version/version.go
# Should show: Version = "X.Y.Z"

# Clear Go module cache and retry
go clean -modcache
go install github.com/ajramos/giztui/cmd/giztui@vX.Y.Z
```

### **Tag Management Issues**

**Problem**: Need to fix release after tagging
```bash
# DON'T move published tags - create patch release instead
# Example: v1.2.0 has issues → create v1.2.1

echo "X.Y.Z+1" > VERSION
# Update version.go and CHANGELOG.md
git add VERSION CHANGELOG.md internal/version/version.go
git commit -m "release: prepare vX.Y.Z+1 patch release"
git tag vX.Y.Z+1
git push origin main && git push origin vX.Y.Z+1
```

**Problem**: Workflow didn't trigger on tag push
```bash
# Check if tag was pushed correctly
git ls-remote --tags origin | grep vX.Y.Z

# Manual workflow trigger (if needed)
gh workflow run release.yml -f version=vX.Y.Z
```

### **Version Consistency Issues**

**Problem**: Different versions in different build methods
- **Make builds**: Use VERSION file + git info → Always correct for releases
- **Go install builds**: Use hardcoded version.go → Must be manually synced
- **Workflow builds**: Use ldflags injection → Always correct for releases

**Solution**: Always update both VERSION and version.go files before releasing.
