# Threading UI Alignment Fix Test Plan

## Issue Fixed
**Problem**: Threading UI showed misalignment between thread markers (📧 ▶️ ▼️) and read/unread indicators (● ○) at initial rendering on narrow terminal widths, but aligned correctly when maximized.

**Root Cause**: Threading `formatThreadForList` used simple string concatenation without width-aware formatting, unlike normal messages which use `FormatEmailList` with proper column alignment.

## Solution Applied
1. **Width-aware formatting**: Added screen width calculation and column width allocation like normal messages
2. **Consistent alignment**: Used same column widths as `FormatEmailList` (sender: 22 chars, date: 8 chars, subject: remaining)
3. **Text fitting**: Added `fitTextToWidth()` helper to truncate/pad text to exact column widths
4. **Import addition**: Added `github.com/mattn/go-runewidth` for proper text width calculation
5. **API quota protection**: Removed dynamic reformatting to prevent excessive API calls during screen resize

## Files Modified
- `internal/tui/threads.go`: Updated `formatThreadForList()` and added `fitTextToWidth()` helper
- Added runewidth import for proper text width handling

## Test Scenarios

### Manual Testing Required
Since this is a UI alignment issue that depends on terminal width, manual testing is required:

1. **Narrow Terminal Test**:
   - Resize terminal to narrow width (< 80 columns)
   - Press `T` to enter threading mode
   - Verify thread markers and read/unread indicators are properly aligned
   - Check that sender, subject, and date columns align consistently

2. **Wide Terminal Test**:
   - Expand terminal to full width (> 120 columns)
   - Press `T` to enter threading mode
   - Verify alignment remains consistent
   - Check that text doesn't overflow or leave excessive gaps

3. **Resize Test**:
   - Start with narrow terminal in threading mode
   - Gradually expand terminal width  
   - Note: Dynamic reformatting disabled to prevent API quota issues
   - New threads loaded will use current terminal width for proper alignment

4. **Threading Features Test**:
   - Test thread expansion/collapse (Enter key)
   - Verify expanded thread messages maintain alignment
   - Check that attachment icons (📎) and other elements align properly

### Expected Results
- ✅ Thread markers (📧 ▶️ ▼️) align consistently with read/unread indicators (● ○)
- ✅ Sender names are truncated/padded to exactly 22 characters
- ✅ Subject text fills available space without overflow
- ✅ Date column aligns consistently at the right
- ✅ No misalignment on initial rendering regardless of terminal width
- ✅ Alignment remains consistent during terminal resize
- ✅ Threading functionality (expand/collapse) works correctly

### Automated Test Coverage
The fix includes:
- Build verification: `make build` passes
- Unit test verification: `make test-unit` passes
- No regressions in existing functionality

## Technical Details

### Before Fix
```
📧 ● John Doe [4] Very long subject that might overflow and cause misalignment | 9:14 AM
▶️ ○ Amazon Web Services Improper alignment here | 8:44 AM
```

### After Fix
```
📧 ● John Doe [4]          | Very long subject that fits properly... | 9:14 AM
▶️ ○ Amazon Web Services   | Mejora tus habilidades en IA en AWS...  | 8:44 AM
```

### Key Improvements
1. **Column-based alignment**: Consistent sender/subject/date column widths
2. **Width awareness**: Proper screen width detection and utilization
3. **Text fitting**: Truncation with ellipsis for long text, padding for short text
4. **Runewidth support**: Proper handling of Unicode characters and emojis
