# Test Plan: Message Threading Feature

## Feature Overview
This test plan verifies the complete message threading functionality implementation in Gmail TUI, including threaded conversation display, keyboard shortcuts, command interfaces, AI integration, and configuration options.

## Prerequisites

### Setup Requirements
- Gmail TUI built successfully with latest threading implementation
- Gmail account with conversation threads (replies to emails)
- Test emails with reply chains containing at least 3 messages in conversation
- LLM provider configured (Ollama/Bedrock) for AI summary testing
- SQLite database initialized with threading schema (v7 migration)

### Test Data Preparation
1. **Create test threads via Gmail web interface:**
   - Send email to yourself with subject "Test Thread 1"
   - Reply to create 2-3 message conversation
   - Create additional threads with different message counts
   - Ensure some threads have unread messages
   - Include threads with attachments and different participants

2. **Configuration verification:**
   ```bash
   # Verify config contains threading section
   cat ~/.config/giztui/config.json | grep -A 10 '"threading"'
   ```
